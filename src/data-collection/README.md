# Data Collection

The data collection consists of two files. The first file, inside_airbnb_link_scraper.py, is a program that is used to scrape the data download links of all cities that are listed on the website [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). The second file, data_download.R, is a program that downloads the datasets from the aforementioned data download links and merges the datasets together into one file. 

The datasets that were downloaded from Inside Airbnb contain 31 variables that were further used in the preparation and analysis of the data. The table below shows a description of these variables.
