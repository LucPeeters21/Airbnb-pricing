To examine the relationship between the metric dependent variable and the XX independent variables, a multiple linear regression has been performed. This enables us to account for all important factors and get a precise understanding of the relationship between each individual factor and the price of an Airbnb.

The first thing that was checked is whether the residuals of the dependent variable were normally distributed. After plotting the distribution of the dependent variable it showed us that it was not normally distributed. Since the dependent variable was not normally distributed, we took the natural logarithm of the variable to make
