# AirBnb - Don't Pay Too Much

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

In the early years of Airbnb's existence, the business was widely known as an affordable and friendly way to travel. The fact that it was a way for hosts to make some extra money and for travellers to find a bed for competitive prices turned the concept into a massive success. However, the growth of Airbnb comes with certain disadvantages. One of them is the increasing cost of renting an accomodation trough Airbnb.
