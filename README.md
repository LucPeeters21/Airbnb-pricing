# AirBnb - Don't Pay Too Much

In the early years of Airbnb's existence, the business was widely known as an affordable and friendly way to travel. The fact that it was a way for hosts to make some extra money and for travellers to find a bed for competitive prices turned the concept into a massive success. However, the growth of Airbnb comes with certain disadvantages. One of them is the increasing cost of renting an accomodation trough Airbnb. The project will focus on creating a price estimating tool that both hosts and renters of Airbnb accomodations can use to become better informed about the average price for similar accomodations. Hosts can use this information in order to set a price and renters can use it to decide whether they are willing to pay a certain price

The data used in the research is gathered useing an available Airbnb dataset, with additional data retrieved through scraping the Airbnb website. The data will be used to build a tool that, for both host and renter, answers the question: *"What is the average price for an accomodation similar to the one that I am renting?"*. This tool will be based upon *linear regression* and includes variables that are retrieved from the available and scraped Airbnb data. The outcome variable will show the average price of an accomodation with characteristics that are used as input variables. These variables are based on characteristics regarding (1) ***demographics*** (e.g., city, neighbourhood, nearby facilities), (2) ***accomodation*** (e.g., rating, situated floor, sauna/hottub, Wi-Fi, balcony, number of bedrooms etc.) and (3) ***host*** (e.g., number of accomodations owned by hosts).
